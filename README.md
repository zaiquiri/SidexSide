Reading sides with another person before an audition makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE when it comes to doing well in the room, but we all get tired (and a bit self-concious perhaps) of asking our freinds to run lines with us all the time.  At the same time, it's also really hard to "practice" as an actor - unlike, say mucisians, we can't just lock ourselves in a room with our intrument for 8 hours...

BUT!  What if as an imminent auditioner there was a way to find an actor near you who would gladly read your sides with you.  AND, what if as an actor looking to keep thier chops sharp there was a way to find people with a real scenes from real scripts that needed to rehearse in a serious way?

What do you do?  You take Tinder, Grindr, subtract the sex and add in the rehearsal room - a splash of talent as well, and viola - you got SidexSide.  You'll never be without a scene partner again. B)
